# HandWrittenDigitRecognitionModel_and_GUI
Handwritten Digit Recognition model by using machine library and deep learning library,  and GUI by using Tkinter.
here, first we trained our model using keras, tensroflow etc. with the help of MNIST_HANDWRITTEN dataset and then we made a GUI for the people so that they can interact with that.
